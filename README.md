# SecFiles

SecFiles (Secure Files) is a simple bash script that can take and compare snapshots of your filesystem alerting you about the changes.

You can use the service called *cron* to schedule your checks.

The script will alert you with a messagebox. This is the legend of the symbols:
* + new file
* - deleted file
* x edited file
